        <h1>Guardianship And Making The Decision For Your Family</h1>
        <div>
        <h2>A guardianship is a legal action</h2>
        <div>
          A guardianship is a lawsuit. In Arizona the guardian does not have control over 
          the person’s finances, they only have duties and responsibilities to protect the alleged 
          incapacitated person. It is a constitutional taking of a person’s right to make their 
          own decisions. However, it does not benefit the person filing the lawsuit. Rather, this 
          legal action is to protect the alleged incapacitated person because they are vulnerable. 
          The burden of proof to establish that a person is incapacitated is high, clear and 
          convincing evidence, the only higher burden is in criminal law, beyond a reasonable 
          doubt. A guardianship is a lawsuit but the person seeking relief gets nothing other than 
          the right to protect their loved one. 
        </div>
        <h2>Due process</h2>
        <div>
          Because establishing a guardianship is a legal process that involves the removal of an 
          individual’s constitutional rights. Therefor there are considerable due process protections 
          when the guardianship is established. The alleged incapacitated person has the right to
          <ul>
            <li>Notice to all proceedings</li>
            <li>Representation by an attorney</li>
            <li>Attend all hearings/court proceedings</li>
            <li>Object or contest the appointment including, the right to a trial and the ability to compel, confront, and cross examine all witnesses</li>
            <li>Present evidence</li>
            <li>Appeal the determination of the court</li>
            <li>A clear and convincing burden of proo</li>

        <h2>Who needs a guardian?</h2>]
        <div>
        Only adults who are incapacitated need a guardian. Guardianship is a big deal because it can 
        take away an adult’s ability to make most or all of their decisions, even very personal 
        decisions. This is not for your child turning 18 who worry won’t make good decisions. 
        Guardianship is for someone who has a medical condition the prevents them from receiving and 
        evaluating information to the extent that the person cannot meet their own essential needs for 
        physical safety, health and self-care. Arizona law defines an "Incapacitated person" to mean 
        any person who is impaired by reason of mental illness, mental deficiency, mental disorder, 
        physical illness or disability, chronic use of drugs, chronic intoxication or other cause, 
        except minority, to the extent that he lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make or 
        communicate responsible decisions concerning his person.

          <h2>You have to use evidence to prove the person's incapacity</h2>
          <div>
          A physician, psychologist, neuropsychologist or nurse practitioner must evaluate the 
          person to determine their level of capacity and abilities. There is a form on the court 
          website that can be submitted to the person’s medical provider to learn if the person 
          you think needs protection is incapacitated. The medical provider does not need to state 
          that the person is incapacitated or that they

        <div>
          <h2>Does there have to be Court hearing?</h2>
          <div>
            There does have to be a court hearing. A guardianship action is a constitutional 
            taking of an adult’s right to make their own decisions. But it is not as bad as it 
            sounds. The probate court is less formal in the protective proceedings and will make 
            accommodations for the person who needs a guardian. If the person who needs a guardian 
            agrees that the need a guardian and agrees on who should be appointed the court hearing 
            usually lasts about 15 minutes.

        <div>
          <h2>Which medical provider should I use?</h2>
          <div>
            Typically, it is the medical provider who knows the person best so they have the ability 
            to render an opinion on the person’s abilities. The medical provider is not diagnosing 
            or making a finding of incapacitated that is done by the court. They are informing the 
            court of the person’s abilities to make and communicate responsible decisions.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Who is the ward?</h2>
          <div>
            Ward is an unfortunate term that still exists in statute. Before a person is determined 
            by a court to be incapacitated, they are referred to as the alleged incapacitated person 
            or proposed ward. If a court determines a person to be incapacitated the statute defines 
            that person as a ward, a person subject to the court’s jurisdiction.

        <div>
          <h2>How long does the appointment process take?</h2>
          <div>
            This will vary by county. In Maricopa and Pima county the initial hearing will set 
            within 45-60 days depending on holidays.

          <h2>Jurisdiction and venue 14-5102</h2>
          <div>
            The Arizona Superior Court has jurisdiction to decide guardianship matters. In most 
            counties there are not specific divisions in which judges preside only over specific 
            types of cases. However, due to the size of Maricopa County there are separate division 
            by matter type. There is a probate division in which adult guardianship matters are held. 
            The proposed protected person should reside in Arizona. In a guardianship matter the 
            Arizona court can only make decisions about people who are in Arizona or are present in 
            Arizona. the persons’ capacity and other important constitutional considerations, the 
            person should be a resident of Arizona. The guardianship action is filed in the county 
            where the person resides permanently.  If there is a question about where the person 
            resides or in what county the guardianship should be filed you should consult an attorney.

          If a child is turning 18 and still needs a someone to make decisions for them you may file 
          for guardianship six months before their 18th birthday. The order takes affect on their 
          18th birthday. This is important because before the child turn 18 the parents still have 
          the right to obtain health information under HIPPA. This makes it easier to get the 
          required Physician Report completed.
