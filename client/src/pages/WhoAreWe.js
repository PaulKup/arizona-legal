            <div>
                I have been an attorney for over 20 years. I love my job it is rewarding to help families. Raising 
                any child is challenging. I know we have five together. 
            Jennifer L. Kupiszewski understands the challenges of raising a child with special healthcare needs. 
            Some children will still need their parents to make decisions for them even after they turn18. 
            For some families the need for guardianship is clear and for others it is an agonizing choice. 
            After 20 plus year of practice in the area of adult guardianship she has walked that journey with many 
            families whether it was needed for their child or an aging parent. This is more than a job for her. 
            In 2002 Jennifer and her two children were struck by an impaired driver in an auto accident that 
            almost killed her children. They struggled through physical disability and traumatic brain injury. 
            She knows the exhaustion and frustration with systems and the joy of shared success when they are 
            overcome. Jennifer’s  working with clients who need to obtain guardianship, but it is expensive. 
            For years she has done community events and volunteered her time helping families who could not 
            afford an attorney. In 2017, her niece Airleigh was born with Down Syndrome. Jennifer, and her 
            sister, Cheryl, began planning for Airleigh for the long-term including a possible guardianship. 
            Cheryl will tell you it is really nice to have a sister who is an attorney to help navigate these 
            issues. But you shouldn’t need a lawyer to continue helping your child when they turn 18. There 
            had to be a better way. Jennifer decided to try and make guardianship easier for families. 
            You shouldn’t have to choose between a new refrigerator and obtaining guardianship for your loved 
            one. So here we are with DIY Az guardianship! It’s been a long and mostly successful journey. We 
            are glad you are and hope we can help.
