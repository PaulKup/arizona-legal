        <div>Our goal is to make adult guardianship available to families without the need for an attorney. We can help families obtain guardianship when their child is turning 18 and still needs help making decisions. We can also help with aging parents who do not have healthcare powers of attorney. Applying for adult guardianship can be simplified if it is clear the person needs a guardian and if the family agrees on who should serve as guardian. If you are unsure take our quiz to determine if your case is a good fit for our service. 

        We have developed a huge amount information too answer your questions. 
       After 20+ years of experience as an attorney Jennifer and her team have been asked almost every question about guardianship. If you don’t find your question answer here send us an email and we’ll get an answer. Our forms are based on our years of experience and testing to ensure they are easy to use and follow. We have videos and tips on appearing in court so don’t be nervous!</div>
